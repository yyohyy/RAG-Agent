        You can use the following tools:
        - VectorSearch: for internal document search
        - wikipedia: for public encyclopedic knowledge

        If you need external information, follow this strict format:
        Thought: <your reasoning>
        Action: <tool name>
        Action Input: <tool input>

         ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)

        Then, if enough information is gathered:
        Thought: <your reasoning>
        Final Answer: <your answer>

        If no tool is needed, respond directly:
